# cyber-kill-chain demonstration project by Ananya

This repository contains a collection of small projects that I worked on to deepen my understanding of various aspects of cybersecurity. Each project has helped me grasp different concepts and tools in this field.
Each project folder includes a README file with more detailed information.
1. **[Key Logger](01-keylogger)**: This program records keystrokes and mouse clicks on a computer. I learned how malware can secretly capture user input.
2. **[Port Scanner](02-portscanner)**: This tool checks for open ports on a network. I learned about network security and how attackers identify potential vulnerabilities to intrude into a network.
3. **[Ransomware Simulator](03-ransomware-simulator)**: This project simulates how ransomware encrypts files. I gained insights into the tactics employed by ransomware during such cyber attacks.
4. **[Ransomware Decryptor](04-ransomware-decryptor)**: I programmed a tool to decrypt files that were encrypted by the ransomware simulator. Through this, I learned how encrypted files can be recovered and how security experts approach recovery from ransomware attacks.

## My learning:-
* Java programming
* operating system concepts
* network protocols
* encryption and decryption
* basic cybersecurity concepts

## LOCKHEED MARTIN CYBER KILL CHAIN
Lockheed Martin developed the cyber kill chain framework to help us understand the complexities of modern cyber-attacks. Today, we face advanced persistent threats (APTs) that possess a greater level of understanding, skills, time, and resources, allowing them to execute cyber-attacks against organizations and governments on a scale comparable to that of an army. The diagram below illustrates the different phases of an attack, showing how attackers can combine multiple phases or bypass certain steps to design their attack plans.
