# cyber-kill-chain demonstration project by ananya

This repositary contains a collection of small projects on which i worked to learn more about different aspects of cybersecurity. Each project helped me understand various concepts and tools in this fields.

1. **[Key Logger](01-keylogger)** : a program that recored keystokes and mouseclicks on a  computer. I learnt now malware can secretly capture input.
2. [Port Scanner](02-portscanner): a tool that checks for open ports on a network . I learnt about network security adn now attackers identify ways to intrude into a network.
3. [Ransomware Simulator](03-ransomware-simulator): a simulation of how ransomware encrypts files. i learnt about the tactics of a ransomware in this type of cyber attack.
4. [Ransomware Decryptor](04-ransomware-decryptor): programed two decrypt files encrypted by the ransomware simultor. I learnt how the ransomware encrypted files are recovered, and how security experts might approach recovery from a ransomware attack.

Each project folder has a README file with more details.

## What i learnt

* Java programming
* operating system concepts
* netwrok protocols
* encryption adn decryption
* basic cybersecurity concepts

## LOCKHEED MARTIN CYBER KILL CHAIN
Lockheed martin came up with this cyber-kill-chain framework to add understanding to the complexities of modern day cyber attacks. Today we deal with advanced persistant threats (APT) who have greater understanding , skills, time and resouces to carry out cyber attacks against organisations and world governments at a scale equivalent to an army. the below diagram displays how each phase of an attack is composed, and how attackers may combine multiple phases or skip through some to arcitect rheir attack plans.
